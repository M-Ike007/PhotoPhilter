# TODO this file will have a class that is a tkinter window that lets the user finetune their photo sorting.
# important is the amount of photos. If it is generally small, we can use some type of interface.
# if it is a lot, maybe a different type of interface is required?
# lets start with an interface for generally normal/small sized assorted photos
# there should be an execute button that deletes the actual photos and keeps the rest.
# there should be something done with the decide later as well...
