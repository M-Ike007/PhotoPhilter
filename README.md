# PhotoPhilter
## Introduction
PhotoPhilter is a photo sorting application, that attempts to make it as easy as possible to work as fast as possible. It does this by showing only one image at the time, as opposed to other software that shows many photos at the time, which can be overwhelming and unnecessary depending on the amount of photos.
Another way PhotoPhilter tries to be fast is by giving the user as much possibility to tweak settings to their liking. For example, in the future I would like to add the possibility that user can change keybindings of different buttons.

## Tkinter & PIL library
I mostly use Tkinter library and PIL/pillow (python imaging library) in the code. tkinter is useful for making nice GUI's and PIL adds functionalities for image processing. 
## 3 different GUI's
there are currently 3 different GUI's:
1. **Setup**: user can change settings and folder
2. **Sorting**: user can sort images one by one
3. **Final sort**: user can have a last look at the decisions made and change last decisions.

Thank you for reading :)
